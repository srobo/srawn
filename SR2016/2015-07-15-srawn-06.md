This is the sixth issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

- James Thompson has [won the position of Public Interaction][list-election-result] on the steering committee.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together.
