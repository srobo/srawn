The Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter is a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones for which additional help has been requested.

## The competition has begun

The competition is well underway now. This year, in The Neutral Zone, teams are tasked with sorting out some mixed up chemicals. Their mission is to collect and catalogue samples, being careful which ones they collect. But when working with strong chemicals, care must be taken. If teams get acidic and basic samples too close together, they’ll react and neutralise each other, making them worthless. Feel free to check out [the rulebook](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/) for the exact details.

Teams are building their robots and submitting challenges, communicating with their teammates and other teams in our Discord. A big thanks to Karina for their work overhauling our Discord Bot to make creating and managing guilds that much simpler.

## Challenge Days

We've planned 2 Challenge Days for SR2026. Similar to tech days, they're a chance for teams to get in a room and work on their robot with hands-on support from us blueshirts. But unlike tech days, these days are primarily focused around completing and judging challenges. 

We're planning on running 2 Challenge Days:

- [**24th January 2026** - at Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2026/cambridge-challenge-day-january)
- [**21st February 2026** - at Red River Software in Horsham](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2026/horsham-challenge-day-february)

## Competition Dates

We are happy to confirm that [Student Robotics 2026](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2026/competition/) will be taking place on **Saturday 11th April to Sunday 12th April** at the University of Southampton Students' Union!

We'll formally collect sign-ups soon, including more details for the schedule for the event

## Weekly Forum

After a Holiday Hiatus, our Weekly Forum meetings are back. We meet weekly on a Wednesday at 19:30 (UK) to discuss outstanding tasks, review issues and generally progress the competition. It's the best way to get involved with helping organise the competition cycle - **Anyone is welcome**. The calendar event and call details can be found in [our public calendar](https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/volunteering/calendars/).
